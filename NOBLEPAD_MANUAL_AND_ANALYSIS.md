## 📘 For Investors: Your Investing Guide

### 1. The Staking Hub (`/staking`)
**Goal:** Unlock higher allocations and exclusive benefits.
*   **What you can do:** Stake your **BELGRAVE** tokens to earn "Tier Status".
*   **Why?** Higher tiers mean you can buy *more* tokens in a hot presale before they sell out.
*   **Tiers:**
    *   🥇 **Gold (175M BELGRAVE):** Guaranteed allocation, lowest fees, early access.
    *   🥈 **Silver (87,5M BELGRAVE):** High allocation, community voting rights.
    *   🥉 **Bronze (17,5M BELGRAVE):** Lottery-based allocation.
*   **Example:** You have 60,000 BELGRAVE. You stake 50,000 to become a **Silver Member**. Now, when the "Next Big AI Coin" launches, you have a reserved spot to buy $500 worth of tokens, while non-stakers have to fight for scraps.

### 2. Finding Presales (`/presales`)
**Goal:** Discover and invest in new projects.
*   **What you can do:** Browse a list of "Live", "Upcoming", and "Ended" presales.
*   **Key Feature - The AI Score:** Every project has a score from 0-10 based on GitHub activity, whitepaper quality, and team transparency.
    *   🟢 **8.0 - 10.0:** High quality, safe bet.
    *   🔴 **0.0 - 4.0:** Risky, proceed with caution.
*   **Example:** You see a project called "SafeMoon 2.0". It has an AI Score of **3.2**. You check the details and see the "Liquidity Lock" is missing. You decide *not* to invest. Smart move!

### 3. Your Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
**Goal:** Track your money and portfolio.
*   **What you can do:** See all the tokens you've bought, your claimed tokens, and your staked BELGRAVE balance.
*   **Example:** You bought into 3 different presales last month. Instead of checking 3 different pages, you go to your Dashboard and see exactly how much they are worth now and if any are ready to claim.

## 🛠️ For Developers: Your Launch Guide

### 1. Token Creator (`/create-token`) *Coming Soon*
**Goal:** Create a token without writing code.
*   **What you can do:** Generate a standard, audited ERC-20 token in seconds.
*   **Example:** You have a great idea for a "Dog Walker Community" token but don't know Solidity. You use this tool, type in the name "WalkerCoin", supply 1 Million, and click "Deploy". Done.

### 2. Creating a Presale (`/create`)
**Goal:** Raise funds for your project.
*   **What you can do:** Set up an Initial Liquidity Offering (ILO).
*   **Key Inputs:**
    *   *Soft Cap:* Minimum money needed (e.g., 10 ETH).
    *   *Hard Cap:* Maximum money wanted (e.g., 50 ETH).
    *   *Liquidity Lock:* Percentage of funds automatically locked in Uniswap (must be > 60% for safety).
*   **Example:** You want to raise 50 ETH for marketing. You set a Hard Cap of 50 ETH. You set the "Liquidity Rate" to 70%, meaning 35 ETH goes straight to Uniswap to create a trading pool, and 15 ETH goes to your wallet for marketing expenses. This builds massive trust.

### 3. Token Locks (`/token-locks`)
**Goal:** Prove you are trustworthy.
*   **What you can do:** Lock your Team Tokens or Liquidity Tokens.
*   **Why?** Investors hate "Rug Pulls" (when devs sell all their tokens and run). Locking proves you *cannot* sell.
*   **Example:** Your team owns 10% of the supply. You lock these tokens for **2 Years** using the Token Lock page. Investors see this "2 Year Lock" badge on your presale and feel safe investing.

### 4. Creator Analytics Dashboard (New!)
**Goal:** Track your fundraising success like a pro.
* **What you can do:** Access the "Creator View" in your Dashboard to see detailed charts.
* **Metrics:** View "Total Raised", "Conversion Rates", and daily funding volume graphs.
* **Why?** Data helps you optimize your marketing during the active presale period.

### 5. Fair Launch Mode (New!)
**Goal:** Raise funds without a hard ceiling.
* **What you can do:** Choose "Fair Launch" during the Presale Setup.
* **Difference:** Unlike "Standard" presales, there is no "Hard Cap". The price is determined dynamically or supply is unlimited until the sale ends.
* **Use Case:** Ideal for meme coins or hyped community projects where you don't want to limit ticket size.

### 6. Community Quests (New!)
**Goal:** Get free marketing from your investors.
* **What you can do:** Enable the "Quests" tab on your presale.
* **How it works:** Users complete tasks like "Follow on Twitter" or "Join Telegram" to verify their wallet.
* **Benefit:** You gain thousands of followers; they gain exclusive rewards or whitelists.

## 📊 Competitive Analysis & Upgrade Advice

### Comparison: NoblePad vs. The Giants

| Feature | **NoblePad** | **PinkSale** | **Unicrypt (UNCX)** | **Polkastarter** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Primary Focus** | Security & AI Analysis | Volume & Speed | Liquidity Locking | High-Quality Curated IDOs |
| **Chains** | **EVM + XRPL** (Unique!) | EVM + Solana + more | EVM Only | EVM Only |
| **Safety Check** | **AI Safety Score** (Built-in) | KYC (3rd Party) | Audits (3rd Party) | Strict Manual Vet |
| **Token Locks** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (Standard) | ✅ Yes (Industry Leader) | ❌ No (IDO mainly) |
| **User Experience** | Modern "Glassmorphism" | Functional / Cluttered | Technical / Dry | Premium |

### ✅ Where NoblePad Wins (Our "Moat")
1.  **AI Integration:** No other major launchpad gives an instant "AI Safety Score". This is a massive selling point for retail investors who don't know how to read code.
2.  **XRPL Support:** The XRP Ledger is huge but under-serviced. Integrating Xaman (Xumm) wallet and native XRPL support gives us access to a loyal, wealthy community that PinkSale ignores.
3.  **Aesthetics:** The "Premium Dark/Gold" design feels much more professional than the chaotic, colorful mess of some competitors.

### ⚠️ Where We Lag (Upgrade Advice)
1.  **Social Proof & Trends:**
    *   *Missing:* A **"Trending Now"** bar. PinkSale charges money to list projects here, creating revenue.
    *   *Advice:* Add a "Hot #1" ticker at the top of the site based on recent views/buys.
2.  **Referral System:**
    *   *Missing:* An Affiliate link generator.
    *   *Advice:* Let users earn 2% of the ETH raised if they refer a buyer. This turns every user into a marketer for us.
3.  **KYC/Audit Badges:**
    *   *Missing:* Visual badges that say "KYC Verified" or "Audited".
    *   *Advice:* Even if we don't do it ourselves, partner with a firm (like CertiK or SolidProof) and display their badge on the Presale Card manually or via API.
4.  **Community interaction:**
    *   *Missing:* A comment section on presales (Disqus or wallet-signed messages).
    *   *Advice:* Allow investors to ask questions directly on the presale page.

### 🚀 Strategic Roadmap
1.  **Immediate:** Implement the **Affiliate System**. It's the cheapest way to grow viral traffic.
2.  **Short-term:** Build the **"Trending" Algorithm** (Views + Buys in last 24h) to create "FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out).
3.  **Long-term:** Deepen the **AI Analysis** to scan smart contract code for common bugs (honeypots) automatically.
