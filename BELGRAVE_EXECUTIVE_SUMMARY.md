# BELGRAVE SYSTEM: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## The Standard for Decentralized Allocation

## Mission

The **Belgrave System** eliminates the chaos of early-stage fundraising. By replacing random lotteries and gas wars with a deterministic, tier-based staking protocol, we provide a predictable and fair access mechanism for the next generation of digital assets.

## The BELGRAVE Token

BELGRAVE is the single key to the system. It is not a currency for spending; it is an asset for **staking**.

* **Total Stake Requirement**: A fixed amount of BELGRAVE must be locked for 6 months to earn Membership.
* **Zero Fees**: Staking incurs no protocol fees.

## Membership Tiers

| Tier | Staked BELGRAVE | Multiplier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🥉 **Bronze** | **17,500,000** | **1.0x** |
| 🥈 **Silver** | **87,500,000** | **2.5x** |
| 🥇 **Gold** | **175,000,000** | **5.0x** |

## Core Advantages

1. **Guaranteed Allocations**: No lotteries. If you stake, you get a share.
2. **Fair Distribution**: Proportional scaling ensures whales cannot eat the entire pool.
3. **Governance Rights**: Stakers dictate the parameters of future pools.
4. **Multi-Chain Access**: One stake grants access to opportunities on **Ethereum**, **Base**, **BSC**, and **XRPL**.

## Security & Technology

* **Snapshot Engine**: Merkle-proof based eligibility verification.
* **Anti-Whale**: Strict per-wallet caps and single-tier enforcement.
* **Live Deployment**: The Belgrave System is currently operational and processing tiers on Mainnet.

## Conclusion

Belgrave is not a feature; it is the foundation of fair capital allocation.
