| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent 1** | **The Scout** | Identifies market pain points and scans institutional/dev titans for entry points. |
| **Agent 2** | **The Visionary** | Drafts sophisticated, technical storytelling threads. Focuses on $BELGRAVE utility. |
| **Agent 3** | **The Institutional Auditor** | Fact-checks content. Strips 'Degen' language. Enforces BlackRock/Grayscale tone. |
| **Agent 4** | **The Stylist** | Optimizes for X.com 2026 "View Velocity." Enforces consultative reply ratios. |
| **Agent 5** | **The Networker** | Executes contextual engagement. Contributes technical value to influencer threads. |
| **Agent 6** | **The Algorithm Guard** | Enforces "Organic Jitter" (90m+) and shadow-ban protection logic. |

## ⚙️ 3. Operational Logic (The Execution Loop)

The system follows a strict linear verification chain for every action:

1. **Strategic Signal**: The Scout finds a technical trigger in a target's narrative.
2. **Narrative Draft**: The Visionary creates a macro-economic storytelling thread.
3. **Quality Audit**: The Institutional Auditor ensures a Grayscale-grade tone (Score > 95%).
4. **Humanize**: The Stylist optimizes for algorithm reach and consultative value.
5. **Networking Hook**: The Networker drafts the custom reply to the target entity.
6. **Algorithm Check**: The Guard ensures no spam triggers or reach penalties.
